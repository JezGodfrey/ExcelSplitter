# ExcelSplitter

This tool was designed for a friend who's PC wasn't powerful enough to open and load large Excel files in Microsoft Excel efficiently.
ExcelSplitter allows users to split Excel files into smaller, more manageable files by row count, or by date (monthly/quarterly).
This is made easier utilising a GUI created using PySimpleGUI.

# How to use
- Pick a folder containing Excel files
- Choose the file from the list (only .xls and .xlsx files will show)
- If there are multiple sheets, select which sheet of data you'd like to split
- Choose whether to split by number of rows, by month, or by quarter
- For rows, input the desired number of rows per file
- For monthly or quarterly, select a column containing dates
- Click the Split button to start!
- The file(s) can be found in the folder selected in the first step
